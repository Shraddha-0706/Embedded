# Embedded Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning and hands-on practice in embedded systems engineering.

## Focus Areas
- Embedded C programming
- Microcontrollers: STM32, MSP430, ESP32
- MCU peripherals (GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, ADC)
- RTOS basics (FreeRTOS)
- Industrial communication (MODBUS, CAN – learning)

## Goal
To strengthen fundamentals, write clean and reusable firmware, and build a strong embedded engineering portfolio.

## Tools
- STM32CubeIDE
- Code Composer Studio
- ESP-IDF
- JTAG/SWD
